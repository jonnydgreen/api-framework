# Model

When designing a RESTful application, one will need to define resources for that
system. A resource is any sort of entity or service that is available to a
client.

Models are abstractions for these resource entities within the system and we
demonstrate and explain how to do this below.

When defining models, a lot of inspiration is taken from
[JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/). Here we start by going through each
supported type in turn.
